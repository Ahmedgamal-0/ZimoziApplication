SELECT

    SELECT
        "EmployeeID",
        "Name",
        "Department",
        "Salary",
        ROW_NUMBER()OVER (PARTITION BY "Department" ORDER BY "Salary" DESC)AS RowNum
    FROM "Employees"
) AS RankedEmployees
WHERE
    RowNum <= 3
ORDER BY
    "Department", "Salary" DESC;

    ----------------------
    Here i used the funtion Row_number so i can get the first nth digit for any query needed,i also used double quotes "" for Case Sensitivity
    and i ordered the result by both department and salary .
